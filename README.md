# protracker-2.3d-mio

this protracker for Linux branch is fetched from Sourceforge

it implements a fix for sorting filenames by names, so if you got 1000 modules/samples you can easily have an overview


by default you cannot sort in the Beta protracker 2.3d from Sourceforge, but in this you can
Not tested on Windows though - uses POSIX and is stable on linux it seems
