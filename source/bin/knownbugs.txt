Known bugs:
 * DISK OP. can list files in a non-sorted order, this really depends on the
   filesystem you use (use SHIFT+key to jump to entry)
   
 * The OpenGL version (and its fullscreen mode) may be extremely slow or
   non-working on computers with an old GPU (update your graphics card's driver)
   
 * Some keybindings are not accessable on Macintosh keyboards
   
 * You can't type numbers while using a French keyboard layout, at least not in
   OS X or GNU/Linux
